        <h2>The nights</h2>
        <p>Once upon a younger year
            When all our shadows disappeared
            The animals inside came out to play
            Went face to face with all our fears
            Learned our lessons through the tears
            Made memories we knew would never fade</p>
        <p>One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
            He took me in his arms, I heard him say
            "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
            Think of me if ever you're afraid"</p>
            <p>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                So live a life you will remember"
                My father told me when I was just a child
                "These are the nights that never die"
                My father told me</p>
